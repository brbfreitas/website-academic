Understanding how one species can split into two is one of the most pressing questions in evolutionary biology, and requires detailed knowledge on the interplay of natural and sexual selection with gene flow in a given geographical and ecological context. For songbirds, vocalisations can be a powerful evolutionary force restricting gene flow, and consequently promoting speciation.

I aim to explore the role of vocalisations in population divergence in two well-studied avian radiations: **chaffinches from La Palma and grey white-eyes from Reunion**. I will analyse songs and calls and will conduct field experiments to confront this information with existing data on population history, morphology, and ecology, in an integrative approach.
