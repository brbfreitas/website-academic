The presence of an undescribed owl on Principe Island was only confirmed in 2016, though the search for a ‘mystery owl’ had begun almost 20 years earlier.
For my [MSc thesis](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/124021) I analysed genetic, morphologic and bioacoustic data of different scops-owl species to **confirm species satatus and to enable the formal description of this owl** (Melo et al. <i>submitted</i>). I also did fieldwork to map the owl's distribution, infer habitat requirements, estimate population size, and assess the threat category for this species, informing **conservation** strategies (Freitas et al. <i>submitted</i>).

Afterwards, I tested the performance of **automatic sound recorders and automated song detection** for owl monitoring in Príncipe and I also investigated more deeply the characteristics of the vocalizations of this owl (Freitas et al. <i>in prep.</i>). 
Currently, I am collaborating with Martim Melo and Fundação Príncipe to put in practice this automatic workflow for acoustic monitoring of the Scops owl and other threatened species on Príncipe Island.
