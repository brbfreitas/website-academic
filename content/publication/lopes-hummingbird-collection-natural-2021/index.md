abstract: Background The Hummingbird (Family Trochilidae) Collection of the Natural
  History and Science Museum of the University of Porto (MHNC-UP) is one of the oldest
  collections of this family harboured in European museums. Almost 2,000 specimens,
  that encompass most of the taxonomic diversity of this family, were collected in
  the late 19th Century. The collection is relevant due its antiquity and because
  all specimens were bought from the same provider, mainly as mounted specimens, for
  a Portuguese private collection of Neotropical fauna. In the early 20th Century,
  it was donated to the Museum that is now the MHNC-UP.
