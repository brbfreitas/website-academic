I am an Evolutionary Biology PhD fellow at the [National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN-CSIC)](https://www.mncn.csic.es/es) in Madrid (Spain) and at the [Laboratory of Evolution and Biological Diversity (EDB, Université Toulouse-CNRS)](https://edb.cnrs.fr/) in Toulouse (France) under the supervision of [Borja Milá](https://borjamila.com/) and [Christophe Thébaud](https://thebaud.weebly.com/). The main focus of the PhD is on the **role of song in speciation processes of island birds**. More specifically, I aim to investigate the role of natural and sexual selection on song divergence and its role in speciation, using two recent and well-studied bird radiations, the chaffinch (<i>Fringilla coelebs</i>) from La Palma Island and the Reunion grey white-eye (<i>Zosterops borbonicus</i>) from Reunion. 

Previously, I was working at the [Center of Evolutionary and Functional Ecology (CEFE-CNRS)](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/) in Montpellier (France), through an Erasmus+ internship and under the supervision of [Claire Doutrelant](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/ee/esp/777-c/152-claire-doutrelant), [Martim Melo](https://cibio.up.pt/en/people/details/martim-melo/), and [Yves Bas](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/dpb/865-pdoc/2827-yves-bas). I analyzed acoustic recordings of the Príncipe Scops Owl to understand the **performance of automatic sound recorders and automated song detection** for owl monitoring in Príncipe and to investigate more deeply the characteristics of the vocalizations of this owl. I also investigated communication characteristics of the sociable weaver (<i>Philetairus socius</i>) within the nest, under the supervision of [Pietro D'Amelio](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pietro-Damelio) and [Claire Doutrelant](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/ee/esp/777-c/152-claire-doutrelant).

My MSc project was developed at the [Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources (CIBIO-InBIO)](https://cibio.up.pt/) in Vila do Conde (Portugal), under the supervision of [Martim Melo](https://cibio.up.pt/en/people/details/martim-melo/), [Angelica Crottini](https://cibio.up.pt/en/people/details/angelica-crottini/), and [Ricardo Lima](https://sites.google.com/site/rfdelimasite/home). I developed a [thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10216/124021) focusing on an integrative taxonomic approach for the delimitation and **description of a new species of Scops Owl** discovered in Príncipe Island, Africa. The project included morphometric, bioacoustic and genetic data, obtained after 3-month field season and visits to museum collections, as well as a strong component on the ecology of the owl.

In addition to my research interests, I enjoy participating in projects related to science communication such as ["Pint of Science"](https://pintofsciencept.wixsite.com/2020) and ["Letters with Science"](https://en.cartascomciencia.org/).
