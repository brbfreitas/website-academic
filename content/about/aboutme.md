I am an Evolutionary Biology PhD fellow at the [National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN-CSIC)](https://www.mncn.csic.es/es) in Madrid (Spain) and at the [Laboratory of Evolution and Biological Diversity (EDB-CNRS)](https://edb.cnrs.fr/) in Toulouse (France) under the supervision of Borja Milá and Christophe Thébaud. The main focus of the PhD is on the **role of song in speciation processes of island birds**. More specifically, I aim 

Previously, I was working at the [Center of Evolutionary and Functional Ecology (CEFE-CNRS)](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/) in Montpellier (France), through an Erasmus+ internship and under supervision of Claire Doutrelant, Martim Melo, and Yves Bas. I analyzed acoustic recordings of the Príncipe Scops Owl to understand the **performance of automatic sound recorders and automated song detection** for owl monitoring in Príncipe and to investigate more deeply the characteristics of the vocalizations of this owl.

My MSc project was developed at the [Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources (CIBIO-InBIO)](https://cibio.up.pt/) in Vila do Conde (Portugal), under supervision of Martim Melo, Angelica Crottini, and Ricardo Lima. I developed a thesis focusing on an integrative taxonomic approach for the delimitation and **description of a new species of Scops Owl** discovered in Príncipe Island, Africa. The project included morphometric, bioacoustic and genetic data, as well as a strong component on the ecology of the owl.

My research interests include studying the processes that led to the current incredible biodiversity, such as speciation, adaptation and radiations, with a special focus on island populations. Essentially, I want to pursue the question on how species have the capacity to adapt to new environments and at a certain point be so different that they can be classified as different taxonomic categories, how certain traits are selected and whether this selection is strong enough to dramatically change the evolution of a species.
