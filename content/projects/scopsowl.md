I am an Evolutionary Biology PhD fellow at the [National Museum of Natural Sciences of Madrid](https://www.mncn.csic.es/es) (Spain) and at the [Laboratory of Evolution and Biological Diversity](https://edb.cnrs.fr/) in Toulouse (France).

My research interests include studying the processes that led to the current incredible biodiversity, such as speciation, adaptation and radiations, with a special focus on island populations. Essentially, I want to pursue the question on how species have the capacity to adapt to new environments and at a certain point be so different that they can be classified as different taxonomic categories, how certain traits are selected and whether this selection is strong enough to dramatically change the evolution of a species.

Currently, I aim to integrate animal vocalizations in the investigation of these questions, making use and contributing to the growing development of methods to facilitate the recording and analysis of animal vocalizations.
